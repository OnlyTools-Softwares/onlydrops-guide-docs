# Superkicks -  ATC

For those who've been here for more than 2 months, they would be versed with going about using Superkicks' ATC tool. I have a bad news and some good news.

The bad part being, our old method was clipped (no cross-origin requests), and had to figure out a workaround. Now, thankfully and surprisingly, our workaroud made the Tool better and a tad bit faster too.

### **Changelogs**

* No need to be logged in to Superkicks beforehand \[since the tool now calls the request from the site itself, normal cart hashes work].
* The cart won't open on and from the same page you added it with, simply, just keep another tab open with the link - [http://superkicks.in/cart/](http://superkicks.in/cart/).
* The tool is faster than before since it now does not have to redirect the request from our server and forward it before reaching the updated Superkicks cart. Instead, it sends the request once it reaches Superkicks, making it as fast as clicking a cart button.

### HOW TO ATC?

The ATC links pop up only on the following channels, #sk-backend and #superkicks-restock, the first step being, clicking the ATC beside the size you want.

!!! info
    Please don't complain about it not working, yes, it mostly works. The main reason it might not work is if the size already went OOS.

Once you click on the link, something like this should pop up on Superkicks.

![Added to cart successfully.](../assets/Screenshot%202021-12-22%20at%201.02.35%20PM.png)

![Unsuccessful add, size is out of stock.](../assets/Screenshot%202021-12-22%20at%201.05.57%20PM.png)

Now, for the same reason as explained above, the cart won't open on this tab. If you try to navigate, you'll get a _**1020 error, Access Denied**_. To access the cart, refresh the other tab \[the one with - [http://superkicks.in/cart/](http://superkicks.in/cart/)]. You can also open this in a new tab, does not matter as much, but to save time we suggest having this open already.

Finally, once you have the cart open a new tab, you'll see your product already added to the cart, and if applicable, secured in your cart by Superkicks' Cart Hold for the next 2:30 minutes. _Checkout and have fun!_
