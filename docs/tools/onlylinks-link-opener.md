# OnlyLinks - Link Opener

### Guide for MacOS:

You can find and download the file from the download link, or the file from [releases-or-downloads](../releases-or-downloads/ "mention").

Just double click on the file, and keep following the prompts.

**ALTERNATE:** Sometimes, the app might show a launch error, if that error persists, just right click on the app, click on **Show Package Contents,** navigate to **Contents,** then **MacOS** and **double-click** on **OnlyLinks.** This should most definitely work.

!!! warning
    If the app does not open, right click on the **executable** mentioned in the above para, and click on **Get Info**, once there, check the **Open with rosetta** option. [for M1 Mac].

    If you get the "file is damaged error", follow this video. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIsYMgagJz4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIsYMgagJz4)

[**HOW TO GET YOUR DISCORD ACCESS TOKEN?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI)



And this is nothing to worry about, we don't save any of your data or tokens, it's all saved locally and is removed from cache everytime you close the script/app. Again, if you logout from that session (session shown in Video), it automatically invalidates your Access Token. This token is needed to remotely check the messages posted in the 2 channels without opening discord each time.

!!! success
    If any further help is needed, [open a ticket in the Discord Server.](https://discord.com/channels/827862513034199050/829252012121915442)

### **SCRIPT PROMPTS**

**SET KEYWORDS:** The comparitor checks for keywords in the link, not in the title, so it can be more accurate. If there's only a particular keyword/product you're looking for, you can add multiple keywords from the link, or in the case of myntra, just add the product ID straight as it is present at the end of the link (eg. [**18800894**](https://www.myntra.com/sports-shoes/nike/nike-men-white-leather-air-jordan-1-low-basketball-shoes/18800894/buy)).

**BLACKLIST KEYWORDS:** Product links containing these words will not trigger a browser action on the script. In case of myntra, just add the product ID, doing that will ignore unneeded products.
