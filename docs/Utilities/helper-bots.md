If your key seems to not be working, or in case of a device or WiFi change, you can always reset the key. This action will then unbind your key from your IP (the key would still remain the same), and make it useable again for activation on another deviceID/WiFi.

All you need to do is, DM the bot. To DM, just find the bot listed on the right, select and hold it and then click on message.

### **Command**

DM the bot **$onlyaco reset,** or use this command in channel **#onlycommand.**

If that for some reason does not work, **$onlyaco reset `<YOURKEY>`** but only over DM**.**

!!! warning "Warning:"
    Instead of KEY and the example I mentioned, paste your own key. Please. I've seen so many members do this petty mistake so please spare us the repeat explanations.
