### Changelogs

* Fixed some rate-limit triggering factors in District (Auto-Queue) module. Recommended to only run 30-40 seconds before the drop, and using proxies (10-20 tasks on localhost is fine).
* Fixed some issues with other Queue-Fair modules.
* Adding a monitor for monitoring the latest queue links to supplement the tool.

### Changelogs

* Added a field in **Settings** for you to **set your Chrome Browser's Version** (installed in your Mac/Windows desktop). \
  \
  The tool will automatically try to fetch the currently installed Chrome version on Startup, if that fails, you can use the **"Fetch Version"** button on the page to **fetch your currently installed Chrome version**, or **simply Copy and Paste your Chrome version** from [**Chrome Settings**](chrome://settings/help) (eg. just copy the numerical part **- 134.0.6998.166**)**.** **This is important to configure if you wish for the Queue-Fair links to work correctly.**<br>
* Fixed issues related to proxies + webhook found in the latest v3.17.1 update - **all Queue-Fair modules**.

**NOTE:**

* Download the 3.17.2 file for your operating system, **ONLY COPY the profiles.json, keys.json, and proxies.json file** (and **tasks.json file** if needed), also the **BMS folder** (if you have cards/upi saved), from the **old folder**, and **paste it in this NEW version's data folder.**
* **DO NOT COPY the old settings.json file**, the bot will crash upon opening since it will not find the new utilities.
* Unlike previous updates, directly copying and pasting the old **data** folder will not work and will give you an error.<br>
