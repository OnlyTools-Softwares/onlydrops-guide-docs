### SIZE SELECTION OPTIONS

_**Restock Mode:**_ Not applicable, choose this option only.

### RECHECK DELAY/REFRESH TIMER

Has various delays options from the fastest to the safest.

* _**Sonic Mode:**_ The fastest, script executes as soon as the last reload is complete (+ 0 seconds).
* _**4x:**_ The most recommended option on most drops, does not get as many "too many request" flags (+1 seconds)
* _**2x:**_ (+2 seconds).
* _**1x:**_ (+4 seconds).
* _**Restock Mode:**_ The safest, script executes every few seconds, so as to not send too many requests and possibly destroying your captcha pass probability and/or increasing bot activity. (+ 5 seconds).
