!!! warning
    Make sure you've been provided a license key by the team before trying to set this up, if not, please ask for one if eligible.

Once you're done installing it, the first popup, i.e, auth should look like this:

Once at this page, fetch your key, and paste it/write it into the box with the "Enter your key to activate" placeholder, when pasted, click on activate.

Once and if your key is verified, you should be moved to the main view of the Auto Checkout tool.

    **NOTE:** You don't need to do this every time, once verified and logged in, it should stay that way as long as you don't change your WiFi (your key is bound to your IP) or been revoked.

### SIZE SELECTION OPTIONS

_**Restock Mode:**_ Chooses a random size out of those in stock for you and checks it out. Helps a lot with restocks when sizes restock randomly. If only 1 size is in stock, it'll stick to that.

_**By Size:**_ Choose the size you want to go with, Yeezy's almost always get half size options (.5 UK), Nike usually only has full sizes on retailers like VegNonVeg, at least on limited releases.

### RECHECK DELAY/REFRESH TIMER

Has various delays options from the fastest to the safest.

* _**Sonic Mode:**_ The fastest, script executes as soon as the last reload is complete (+ 0 seconds).
* _**4x:**_ The most recommended option on most drops, does not get as many "too many request" flags (+1 seconds)
* _**2x:**_ (+2 seconds).
* _**1x:**_ (+4 seconds).
* _**Restock Mode:**_ The safest, script executes every few seconds, so as to not send too many requests and possibly destroying your captcha pass probability and/or increasing bot activity. (+ 5 seconds).

Once set, **TURN ON** the slider and **SAVE** the settings. As soon as you do that, click on save and the extension should minimize itself. That should be all.&#x20;

> Until and unless you reset your key or chance deviceID/IP, your settings should stay saved.

### You're set, now click on your product or open the release/product link in this same browser (same Chrome/Browser Profile), and watch it do the work for you.
